                    <ul>
                        <li>In modern usage, hijab generally refers to various head coverings conventionally worn by many Muslim women. </li>
                        <li>The primary intention of the Hijab is to protect women from evil eyes. And referring to this, Allah says: â€œO Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused.</li>
                        <li>Hijab, meaning to cover, observes the Islamic idea of Awrah, which is the religion's law of covering certain body parts, for both men and women. Hijab, thought to have originated from the Arabic term hajaba, meaning to conceal, refers to men and women needing to wear plain, loose-fitting attire to cover their bodies.</li>
                        <li>Wearing a hijab pleases Allah greatly, and you shall be rewarded with the best and the greatest of things in this life and the hereafter. However, women who chose to disobey and rebel will be punished as not wearing a hijab is considered haram. How to Wear A Hijab in Different Styles?</li>
